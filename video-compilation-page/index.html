			<h1>Computer Science Learning</h1>
			<p>Computer science is a vast field with multiple branches. But whether you work in data science,<br>
			computer networks, cryptography, web development, or another area, you need a strong foundation in<br>
			computer science fundamentals to achieve your goals.</p>
					<section>
				<h2>Programming Language</h2>

				<p>You need to pick a <strong>programming language</strong> to learn the Computer Science concepts.<br>
				Pick C++ or C to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation. In higher<br>
				level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. When you're learning<br>
				how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.</p>

				<h2>Data Structures</h2>

				<p>You also need <strong>Data Structures</strong> to organize the data in the memory<br>
				so that it can be used efficiently. Some common data structures are array, linked list,<br>
				stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.</p>

				<h2>How Computers Work</h2>

				<p>Computers are everywhere. They are in our phones, our cars, our homes, and even in our pockets.You need to know<br>
				<strong>how computers work!</strong> How do they take in information,	and how do they output information?</p>
